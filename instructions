You must do the following things:
Write correct, functioning code.

You will hand craft a program that will apply transformations to a point matrix, given either a script for input or a gui

In addition to the point matrix your programs should currently have, you will add a master transformation matrix (4x4), that will keep track of the transformations to be applied.
Write code to set up a point matrix with the following functionality:
add a point to a point matrix
add an edge to a point matrix (should call your add point routine)
go through a point matrix and draw the lines stored in the matrix (should call your draw line routine)
Write code to work with matrices:
print out a matrix
scalar matrix multiplication
creation of an identity matrix
matrix multiplication
create a translation matrix
create a scale matrix
create a rotation matrix about the x-axis
create a rotation matrix about the y-axis
create a rotation matrix about the z-axis
Note: The trig functions in java, python and c take radians as parameters, but you should assume degree input, make sure to convert or things won't look right.
